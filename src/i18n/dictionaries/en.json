    "title": "Frequently Asked Questions",
    "items": [
      {
        "question": "What is endovascular treatment?",
        "answer": "Endovascular treatment is a minimally invasive procedure performed inside blood vessels using thin tubes called catheters. Instead of open surgery, doctors access the treatment area through a small puncture, typically in the groin. This approach offers faster recovery, less pain, and fewer complications compared to traditional surgery."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do I know if I'm a candidate for endovascular treatment?",
        "answer": "Suitability depends on your specific condition, overall health, and the anatomy of your blood vessels. During your consultation, our specialists will review your medical history, perform necessary imaging studies, and discuss whether endovascular treatment is appropriate for you. We treat each patient individually to determine the best approach."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is the consultation fee covered by insurance?",
        "answer": "Many insurance plans cover specialist consultations and endovascular procedures. We recommend contacting your insurance provider to verify coverage. Our administrative team can also assist with insurance inquiries and provide necessary documentation for claims."
      },
      {
        "question": "How long does recovery typically take?",
        "answer": "Recovery times vary depending on the procedure and individual factors. Most endovascular procedures allow patients to return home the same day or after an overnight stay. Many patients resume normal activities within 1-2 weeks, which is significantly faster than recovery from open surgery."
      },
      {
        "question": "What should I expect during my first visit?",
        "answer": "Your first visit includes a comprehensive medical evaluation, review of any previous imaging or test results, and a detailed discussion of your condition. Our specialists will explain treatment options, answer your questions, and develop a personalized care plan. Please bring your ID, insurance information, and a list of current medications."
      },
      {
        "question": "Do you offer second opinions?",
        "answer": "Yes, we regularly provide second opinions for patients seeking additional guidance on their diagnosis or treatment options. Our specialists can review your case, imaging studies, and medical records to offer an expert perspective on the best course of action."
